# About Me
Hi there! I'm [your name], a Computer Science(BCA) student with a
strong passion for low-level programming languages, embedded systems,
and Unix-like operating systems.

As a programmer, I enjoy working with low-level programming languages
such as C and Assembly, which provide a deeper understanding of how
computers and systems work. I'm also passionate about embedded systems
and enjoy tinkering with microcontrollers and single-board computers to
create interesting projects.

In addition, I'm a big fan of Unix-like operating systems, such as
Linux and OpenBSD, and enjoy exploring their inner workings. I find it
fascinating how these systems can be customized and configured to suit
specific needs.

Apart from programming, I enjoy reading books on various topics,
listening to music, and playing video games. I also love to learn new
things and challenge myself to improve my skills.

Feel free to take a look at my GitHub repositories like my [dotfile]
(https://github.com/iamb4uc/dots), my custom build of suckless's
[dwm](https://github.com/iamb4uc/dwm), among many others, also check
out my website for some goofy blogs and giggles. If you want to connect
with me please reach out to me via my [mail](mailto:b4uc@tuta.io) if
you have any questions or just want to chat about programming!
