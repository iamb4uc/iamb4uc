# 👋 Hi, I’m b4uc
#### [pronounced as *before you see*]
- 👀 I’m interested in anything tech related but mainly linux, cybersecurity, FOSS, and other open-source projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning *some pentesting applications*, Rust and some advance C.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate, since i still think i need to polish my skills much more to contribute to a larger projects, this profile is just for my personal projects and my website that i will be working on. And everything in it is open-source so feel free to use it, you dont have to ask me.
- 📫 You can write me a email at b4uc@tuta.io. I might be a little slow in responding but i will respond eventually.
