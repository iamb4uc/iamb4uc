# Hi, I’m b4uc
#### [pronounced as *before you see*]
- I’m interested in anything tech related but mainly GNU/Linux, Cybersecurity, FOSS, and other open-source projects.
  - besides that I like most other "normal" things like music and books, tho I hate social medias and other media outlets that use computer algorithm that spies on you and does follow basic privacy policies.
- I’m currently learning *some pentesting applications*, Rust and some advance C.
- I’m not looking to collaborate, since i still think i need to polish my skills much more to contribute to a larger projects, this profile is just for my personal projects and my website that i will be working on. And everything in it is open-source so feel free to use it, you dont have to ask me.
- You can write me a email at b4uc@tuta.io. I might be a little slow in responding but i will respond eventually.

*This is a fresh start since my first account was very messy and i was a bit new to github and git. Now I dont think i am a ```beginer``` cause i have gotten a bit used to programming and using different services properly. And I am willing to learn everyday*
